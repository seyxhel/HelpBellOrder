2. Understanding the Codebase
"Where should I start reading the code if I want to modify [specific feature]?"
"Is there documentation or an architecture diagram for the software?"
"What programming languages/frameworks are used, and are there coding standards?"
3. Customization & Extensibility
"How can I add a new feature without breaking existing functionality?"
"Does this software support plugins/modules? How do I create one?"
"Can I change the UI (e.g., themes, layouts) without deep coding knowledge?"
4. Debugging & Troubleshooting
