# Welcome to Zammad

Are you juggling countless customer inquiries across multiple channels?
Struggling to keep your support team on the same page?

packed with features to streamline customer communication across channels like email, chat, telephone and social media.

The Zammad software is and will stay open source. It is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3.
The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/zammad/zammad) and owned by
the [Zammad Foundation](https://zammad-foundation.org/), which is independent of commercial
providers such as Zammad GmbH.
